<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Amrutha! I recently graduated with a B.Tech in Information Technology from JNTUGV Vizianagaram. Currently, I am on a journey to become a full-stack developer. My technical skills include Java, DBMS, JDBC, Spring Boot, and HTML, which form the foundation of my development toolkit.</p>
<p>In addition to my tech pursuits, I'm also a passionate photographer. Capturing moments through the lens of my camera brings me immense joy and allows me to explore the world from different perspectives.
</p>
<p>I'm eager to expand my knowledge and skills, especially in full-stack development, and I look forward to contributing to innovative projects in the tech industry</p>
